# API Exercise - Schools

Use any language and any frameworks/libraries you wish. Consult the internet as necessary.

1. Generate test data consisting of a list of schools:
    * each school will have an integer `id` and string `name`
2. Create endpoint to list all schools
3. Create endpoint to get individual school by `id`
4. Create endpoint to add new school
5. Create endpoint to update an existing school (in this case only the `name` will get updated)
6. Handle looking up non-existent school
7. Host API docs available at `/docs/`
